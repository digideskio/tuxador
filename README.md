A simple, secure door entry/open counter.

Still in the planning phase.


## Goals
=======
- Make a basic counter
- Support one doorway and a tamper switch
- Support proper security open/close/tamper/short loop
- Configurable ability to modify the counter
- Indicate power on time, last tamper/short, last open
- All indications on inexpensive 16x2 character display
- PCB design allows for destroying debugging interfaces
- 4-layer PCB to bury any programming / debugging traces
