HW
==
- everything SMD so it can be epoxied or conformal coated easily
- put tamper stickers on external enclosure, probably more important
- ack button? screen light up button? some complex shit?
- ADC read of proper security loop to door contact
  this means: install proper loop resistors at door contact side
- enclosure has a tamper switch?
- internal tamper switch? can code for 2x doors, or 1x door and 1x tamper.


SW
==
- beep/flash when door is opened?
- beeper and lcd backlight are both on external PWM
- LED indicator for something? maybe flash to show the unit is running?
- error display if reset from watchdog reset or BOD? only boot normally from POR?
  this info may be useful: http://www.avrfreaks.net/forum/determining-reset-source-atmega328p
- show state of various things
  - show overall powered uptime
  - show time since last open
  - show time since last tamper/short
  - show state (open/closed/tamper/short)


IDEA
====
- maybe the front button can be a status/counter button to flip between the two screens,
  showing the counter normally, or the status

- maybe screen can stay flashing in severe alarm cases (tamper/short) until a timeout or
  cleared by getting into the device or something.

- two unused pins are I2C pins, so if you need I2C shit, those are your free pins.
  otherwise they can be unused, used as GPIO, etc.

julian:
you can see why off the shelf units may be ideal - less shit to think about, less code to write :)
if your time is worth nothing (or if you enjoy doing this / learning) then this will be cheaper,
otherwise it can be quite a bit more expensive
